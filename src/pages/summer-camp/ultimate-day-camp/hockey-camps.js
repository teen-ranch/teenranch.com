                <p>In order to keep payments as low-risk as possible for you, we are only requiring a $50 non-refundable deposit per registration. The balance will be due 14 days prior to arrival at camp and is non-refundable. In the case of absence for any reason during the camp week, including homesickness or disciplinary departure, no refund will be issued except upon a signed physician’s order. In this event, a prorated camp refund will be issued, less the $50 non-refundable deposit.</p>
