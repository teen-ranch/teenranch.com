                    The Teen Ranch horse program is for all ability levels to learn or develop their skills on safe, well-schooled horses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beginner riders start with the basics of position and control. Intermediate riders continue to hone the basics while being introduced to new skills. Advanced riders will be challenged to perfect their jumping position, equitation and effective communication with their horse.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Teen Ranch instructors are trained according to CHA standards, putting the largest emphasis on safety, education and fun. All full-time staff are certified in First Aid.

                My child loves Teen Ranch and requests to go every year. That says so much coming from a kid. It is the only camp she is always eager to attend. She loves the horses and horseback riding. She loves the diverse activities, the food, and crafts. The staff are wonderful and friendly and she can't wait to go again!
