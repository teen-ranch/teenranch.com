                <h3>Developing rock-solid faith for real life</h3>  

                <p>
                    This solid, <strong>Christ-centered</strong> experiential program is designed to ground young adults in God's Word and equip them for a vibrant walk with Jesus while challenging them through adventure and outreach.
                </p>    

                <p>
                    Understanding that life will try to undermine and distract them at every turn, this is an amazing opportunity for 17 to 24-year-olds to gain sure footing in this uncertain time by exploring their faith and investing in their walk with the Lord.
                </p>         
                
                <p>
                    The winter session is the debut of an ongoing training program for young adults on-site at Teen Ranch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Winter, Spring, and Fall options are available for the busy young adult to take a brief time away to solidify their faith or to combine sessions to make the greatest training experience possible during a gap year or break from university or work. These sessions can be taken in any order and will pair with Teen Ranch camp and ministry programs for the avid young adult seeking to gain added leadership and ministry experience and invest in young people in-between the offered program sessions or after their time.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Program participants will have the opportunity to be grounded in God’s Word through biblical teaching and personal study as well as grow in disciplines of the faith - prayer, worship, and fellowship - while learning to live out of our connection with the source of true Life, Christ Himself!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sessions taught will focus on books of the Bible and topical studies applicable to young adult faith. Staff and speakers bring a wealth of experience and expertise in sharing with young adults about matters of faith and real-life application. Participants will have time set apart to practice meeting personally with the Lord through His Word and prayer and will have several assignments to help ingrain the truths being taught, including journal assignments, presentations, and book reports. Program staff oversee each individual’s learning and come alongside with weekly meetings and prayer.
                    </p>

                        Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.

                    Outreach is a key component of the program as it challenges and encourages individuals to put their faith into action, both within the Teen Ranch community setting, well as in the local community. Service in the local church, youth groups, community soup kitchen, local food bank, and through Teen Ranch programs will allow growth in developing one's gifting’s and talents, relational interaction, and discovering how sharing one’s faith connects with God’s heart.
                    </p>

                    <Verse reference='1 Peter 4:11a'>
