                    <li><strong>Champion/Reserve Champions</strong> at each show are calculated as follows: 7,5,4,3,2,1.  Champion Tie-Breakers – In the Leadline, Short Stirrup, Beginner & Rookie Division, most points in Equitation wins.  In other divisions, most points over fences wins.  After that or in hack divisions, judge may flip a coin or do conformation line up for the winner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Year-End Awards</strong> – Must show in at least 3 shows in the division to qualify.

                    <li><strong>Fall of horse or rider</strong> = elimination. Rider must exit ring before re-mounting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pony Riders</strong> – we don’t set age limits to show ponies, as we believe it’s better for ponies to get this time in training so they are safe for younger riders later.  </li>
